Use attachment instead of server static 
---------------------------------------
Other common files like js etc should also 
be served through the couchdb attachment 
mechanism.  For example, see how css is being served by 
looking at the common/html/default_css.html file 

The difference seen in server log is: 
localhost.localdomain - - [31/Mar/2012 16:06:09] "GET /socialfarm_business_template/_design/info/facebook.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -
localhost.localdomain - - [31/Mar/2012 16:06:09] "GET /static/js/base.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -



Use specific db for attachment access (low priority)
----------------------------------------------------
Use the current database (if set) to get the attachments instead
of going to the template as is being done now 




Improve README and documentation of code
----------------------------------------
In particular how the {{{ }}} templates are being 
populated by the potato script
