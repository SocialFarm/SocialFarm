Use the make command to clean and create the entire test databases

tested with couchdb python 0.8 

Issues:
====== 
   1. Warning structure of makefile is a bit fragile.  
   2. Need to change the reduce limit in default.ini config file of couchdb because
      job assignment does not shrink quickly enough 



Source: 
======
validate_docs.js
Function which will be used to validate updates to various fields in 
the business databases
