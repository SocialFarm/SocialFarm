play with applet 

get a proper bug/feature list going, possibly on github...

----------------------------------

app : 
    test invite people 
    test social news workflow with a few news items 


javasscript:
    refactor user related code


user experience views
     Business 
         view : workflow, tasks, persons 
         edit/delete : workflow, tasks, persons 


template mapper has trouble with these two, my guess is that it is related to the face they are the same minus the /{mid}:
'api.business.tasks'                : templatemapper('/api/business/{bid}/tasks' ,                          '/{bid}/_design/info/_view/all_tasks'), 
'api.business.tasks'                : templatemapper('/api/business/{bid}/tasks/{mid}',                     '/{bid}/_design/info/_view/all_tasks
