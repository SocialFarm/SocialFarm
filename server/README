server.py 
   server as an http proxy to the local couchdb server that 
   holds various socialfarm data structures.  the server  
   is responsible for 
   a. authentication of accesses and limiting access to couch urls 
      in order to maintain integrity of data 
   b. url rewriting (but this is planned to go away in future) 
   c. doing advanced computation for requests that can not be done 
      within couch db directly

   server can be serving at a given port eg: 
      ./server.py -s localhost:55999
