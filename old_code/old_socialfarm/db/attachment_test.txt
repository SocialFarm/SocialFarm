Note : the rev id may need to be changed to get this specific example 
working 

Command line usage to insert an attachment into the document with id A.  The 
attachment is named API.txt 

    curl -vX PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/testbus/A/API.txt?rev=1-c8522708400eae078ddf949d0d34d594 --data-binary @API.txt -H "Content-Type: text/plain"

    curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/testbus/A
{"_id":"A","_rev":"4-6dbbbe4318f6eaa6081d37ab22b0c277","skills_required":["s1"],"name":"A","data_items":["name","profession"],"successors":["B"],"type":"activity","predecessors":[],"_attachments":{"API.txt":{"content_type":"text/plain","revpos":4,"length":1293,"stub":true}}}
