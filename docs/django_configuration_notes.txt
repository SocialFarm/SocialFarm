Notes on configuring django app
-------------------------------

Googling around for installation guides I found this one and associated articles to be the most helpful:
	http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango

In addition to installing django you will also need to install pyfacebook:

	https://github.com/sciyoshi/pyfacebook/
	see README for installation details
	also http://uswaretech.com/blog/2009/02/how-to-build-a-facebook-app-in-django/

Once mod_wsgi and apache are serving the django app it is likely that there will be a problem with the database configuration. 
make sure the database is defined properly in settings.py

	(see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6082390/django-manage-py-raising-improperlyconfigured-error)

	then initialize the db via:

	python manage.py syncdb
