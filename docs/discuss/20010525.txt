Use cases for FB App and Scarbo 
communication

Suppose a task starts in scarbo. The task 
leads to the creation of a number of subtasks 
which have some dependencies.  

Each subtask must have feilds and role for the 
person who will do it. 

Upon subtask scheduling, the RSTful api (or 
other API) of social network app will
 get a message that has all the fields of 
the task and the role(s) (some tasks may 
need multiple skills) required to complete it. 
At this point, the FB app must select an 
appropriate person from the social netowk 
ansd transform the subtask into a "job" 

FBApp must notify back the completion of 
task to the scheduling engine. 

Engine must be able to check status of a
task by querying the FBapp somehow.
